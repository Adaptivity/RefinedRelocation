Refined Relocation features:

The Filtering:
	- The filtering is a major feature of refined relocation.
	- This is one of the (if not THE) most advanced filtering systems in Minecraft.
	- It is used in a lot of the blocks of the mod
	- Features:
		- It can filter on pre-made filters, which include all ores/planks/logs/dusts etc.
		- It can filter on Creative Tabs, so you can filter all similar types of items without
		having to add them all separately (e.g. BC facades, Project Red Logic)
		- It has a custom filter text-box, which allows users to filter on item names (e.g.
		all items that have the word ore in it). The wildcard character is *. It also has the
		option to filter on oreDictioary name by adding an exclamation mark (!) to the filter.
		The filters should be separated by commas(,)

BLOCKS
Sorting Chest:
	- Has the filtering interface to set up the items that should be put in the inventory
	- Sorting chests placed next to each other will automatically put the inserted item
	(by a player or automated) into the inventory with the best fitting sorting filter
	- Chests that blacklist items will have a lower priority than chests that whitelist items
	- If an item does not pass any filter, it will be added to the chest it was initially put in
	- If Iron Chest is installed, those chest will also have a filtering version
	- Already placed chests can be upgraded with the sorting upgrade to their sorting version
	- Iron Chest upgrades work on filtering chests

Sorting Connector:
	- This block will act like a sorting member, but does not have an inventory
	- Ideal for corners where no chest is wanted
	- The texture of the Sorting Connector can be changed into one of another block
	by shift-right clicking with the Linker on the block with the desired texture and right clicking 
	on the Sorting Connector with the connected Linker.

Block Extender:
	- You can extend the amount of sides a block has by adding a block extender next to it.
	- The Block Extender will put all items/fluids/power into the connected block.
	- Also transmits redstone if enabled (Shift-right click to toggle)
	- The texture of the connected side of the Block Extender can be changed into one of another block
	by shift-right clicking with the Linker on the block with the desired texture and right clicking 
	on the Block Extender with the connected Linker.
	- The Block Extender is upgradable
